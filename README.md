# exPrior

## A Bayesian hierarchical framework for defining informative prior distributions in hydrogeology

This repository (renamed from `rPrior` to `exPrior`) contained the R package implementing the Ex-situ Priors introduced in [Cucchi et al, 2019, ADWR](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0309170818309059). This tool is aimed for practitioners of statistics in hydrogeology to summarize studies from similar hydrogeological sites based on the largest open-source hydrogeological database, and ultimately help better inform inference and prediction at any hydrogeological site.

You can now find this package on CRAN! https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/exPrior/index.html

This code is also moving to bigger and grander things, so if you'd like to stay in touch with latest developments of Bayesian data assimilation for hydrogeology, please visit https://github.com/GeoStat-Bayesian/exPrior.
